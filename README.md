# Flight-Demo
One of my personal projects. Built in Unity and Currently WIP.

Unity Version: 2019.4.38f1 (as of 08/05/2022)

This is a small game project based around having the player control a bird flying through the air. 
This is one of my projects made with the intent of exploring the inherent playfulness of traversal in games. As such, in this project, I will be experimenting with camera control and different player interactions.

The project is architected using a simple version of the Scriptable Object Architecture ([as proposed in this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raQ3iHhE_Kk)). This implementation can be found in Assets/Scripts/SharedObjectArchitecture.
