# Flight-Demo
One of my personal projects. Built in Unity and Currently WIP.
Unity Version: 2019.4.38f1 (as of 08/05/2022)

This is a small game project based around having the player control a bird flying through the air. 
This is one of my projects made with the intent of exploring the inherent playfulness of traversal in games. As such, in this project, I will be experimenting with camera control and different player interactions.
